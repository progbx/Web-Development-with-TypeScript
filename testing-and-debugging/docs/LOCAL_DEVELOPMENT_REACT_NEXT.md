# Local Development

Usually, when working on an HTML page, you need a convenient development environment. By `development environment`, we mean launching an `HTML` page you're working on in your browser and updating it every time you change its content.

## Run with NodeJS in the terminal

## Prerequisites

Please install `NodeJS` and its dependencies. Here are detailed instructions: : [Setup NodeJS for tests and development](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/SetupNodeJS.md).

If you installed all the dependencies, you are good to go.

Open the terminal (`command line, Bash, Git Bash`) to launch a command in the **task root folder**. It is crucial to open it in this exact folder, or it will not work.

To run the command, type or copy it to the terminal and press `ENTER`.

**The command for launching your HTML page in the browser:**

`npm start` will open your `index.html` page with a solution in the browser window. Every time you change its content, it will refresh. It might come in handy when fixing something in your solution. **This task "freezes" your terminal**. To stop it in terminal, press `CTRL + C on Windows(Linux) OS` or `CMD + C` on `MacOS`.
